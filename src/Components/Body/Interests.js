        <p>
          Apart from being a programmer, I enjoy most of my time going outdoors.
          In the weekends, I would go out for walks for my mental health and for
          some exercise.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          When not in the mood to go outside, I follow a number of sci-fi and
          fantasy genre translated novels, I am an aspiring coffee barista, and
          I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the vast, unknown
          worlds that are presented in video games.
